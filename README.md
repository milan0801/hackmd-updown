# hackmd-updown

## Purpose
This is a bookmarklet for a website that can't be scrolled up and down by arrow keys.

For example, when I enter view mode on Hackmd, the arrow keys don't work due to an unknown reason.

## Usage
1. Add a new bookmark.
2. Copy the code in hackmd-updown.js to URL.
3. Click the bookmark when you visit a website with that problem.
